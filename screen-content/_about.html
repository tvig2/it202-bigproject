<h3 class="mdc-typography--headline3">About our origin.</h3>
<p>Starting in early January 2019, we came together and wanted to figure out a way to connect landlords and tenants together as a middleman. That's when we came up with Zoom.</p>
<p>This application was developed by Tarush Vig, a computer science student at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In conjunction with a few other students from UIC, this idea was brought to life through time and effort put in by everyone.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy your apartment search!</p>
